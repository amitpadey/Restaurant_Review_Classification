# Restaurant_Review_Classification

# Project Title: Restaurant Review Classification using NLP in Python



# Objectives:

To develop a restaurant review classification model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques in Python.
To train the model on a dataset of restaurant reviews and to accurately classify reviews as positive or negative.
To use the model to help restaurants improve their customer service and to identify areas where they can improve their food and service.
Methodology:

The project was carried out in the following steps:

Collect a dataset of restaurant reviews.
Preprocess the data by removing stop words, punctuation, and stemming the words.
Vectorize the data into a bag-of-words representation.
Train a machine learning model on the data, such as a Naive Bayes classifier or a support vector machine.
Evaluate the model's performance on a test set of reviews.
Results:

The model was able to accurately classify reviews as positive or negative with an accuracy of 80%. This means that the model was able to correctly classify 8 out of 10 reviews.

# Conclusion:

The project was successful in developing a restaurant review classification model using NLP techniques in Python. The model can be used to help restaurants improve their customer service and to identify areas where they can improve their food and service.


# Future Work:

The project can be extended to use a larger dataset of restaurant reviews. The project can also be extended to use other machine learning models, such as a decision tree or a random forest.
